dfdqf8,f333qmr,"I would like to add my support for this as well. Symbols are **Strong** weapons in the propaganda arsenal, and turning an icon inextricable from Overwatch against Activision-Blizzard would leave a stain on their image that is impossible to remove.  


The best way to establish the authority of a symbol is to make it widespread and prolific. Memes are an excellent tool for this, and have been used in a lot of modern social influence campaigns. So meme this and use it as often as you can, but always stay true to the original message: Mei is a symbol for the liberation of Hong Kong.  


Activision-Blizzard is an excellent Goliath to topple. They are a financial giant with a strong public image to uphold. By corrupting that image, we can sever their ties with China and make an example of what can happen to corporations who turn against humanity.  


Crosspost this. Those of you who support Hong Kong but don't usually post or crosspost, start making exceptions. Even if posts are being removed, keep reposting. Spread Hong Kong's message. Every individual's voice amplifies our reach and grows our movement.

I, too, am disappointed in Blizzard for their actions.

I, too, stand with the protestors and with Hong Kong.

But, there's an angle here I don't think people are talking about, and if they are, certainly not enough.

_We have no idea what went on to pressure Blizzard into making these calls._

Did Tencent threaten to extort them?  Did they threaten to withhold significant capital or go after other investors?  I can imagine Blizzard looking at the threat of losing significant investment from its backers - a problem that would cost perhaps thousands of jobs theoretically - and weighing that against what they were told to do.

It doesn't absolve them, perse, but it's super important that people consider the context that this happened in.  I find it unlikely that they just up and did this without significant pressure.  Which is to say, China is really the enemy here.  Blizzard did a stupid, terrible thing and was ultimately not brave enough to make a difficult and humanitarian choice.  That's not going to change.

There are those that are willing to protest peacefully, and it is those people that the media should be giving their attention to.

There is a fine line between protesting and rioting. To those that are lumping both sides together: please don't.

And those of you claiming that you're ALL protesting peacefully: are you being F*ing serious? Do you seriously think that is true for everyone?

What Blizzard is gonna do if Mei becomes popular and affect the Chinese is the same thing they did with Dota, skin replacement. Both Blizzard and China still stands strong when only one hero gets punished.   
So to dig the grave for Blizzard is making Mei/Winston to recruit a team of followers, where as Mei is the teamleader with several other Overwatch charachters supporting her cause.    
Now imagine 3-7 Heroes getting an overhaul, this will inflict confusion and frustration amongs the players to be acustomed to the new skins, people have to relearn their name and abilities, skins etc.

She is Mei-Ling Zhou, simplified as Mei, a character from Blizzard's popular first person shooter game Overwatch. She is a sweet hearted Chinese scientist in the game set in the future. The game's premise is there is a league of technological heroes set to establish order named the Overwatch.

This character choice is in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dez4yc/breaking_blizzard_entertainment_bans_pro/) esports event where a competitor for a game made by the same company shouted, ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our age!"" in his victory interview. Harsh punishments were sent out, firing both casters (who were completely neutral), retracting all victory money granted to the winner, and the company, Blizzard, sending an apology out only to China.

Now a large portion of the video-gaming community has become very aware of Hong Kong because a company many have loved and supported from a young age has blatantly acted out against human rights.

FAQWhat does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s  
.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",TheFreshHamburger,t1_f32l7ym,-13,3

I've read before that only like 1/10 people upvote, so that post was viewed by at least a million people. Assuming 1% of those viewers have WoW and cancel their subs as well, that's a loss of 10,000 subs, or 150,000 dollars a month.

I'd imagine at least 10,000 people will also no longer be buying Overwatch on Switch resulting in a loss of 600,000 dollars.

Hearthstone will probably see the most direct damage. 10,000 high-spending boycotting players could be a loss of a million dollars.

That's not a *ton* of money for Blizzard, but ultimately the most damage will come from the brand as a whole being associated with Chinese toe-sucking. The stock is already losing value, and will probably bounce back, but developing an eSports scene or catering to the in-the-know playerbase Blizzard is known for will become much harder.

And then there's the chance that Blizzard gets banned from China anyway, which I would personally celebrate.

dfdqf8,f33zvsh,"**Streisand effect**

The Streisand effect is a phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

Fortnite's success has been due to Epic Games, and not TenCent. If Epic wanted they could just buy out TenCent's share in their company and tell them to fuck off. In fact, last I knew Fortnite wasn't even allowed in China. They've made *billions* without China and if you read up on Tim Sweeney, the founder and majority chairperson, I really don't believe he's the type of guy to give a rat's ass about China. He's an interesting fellow with good morals... He's sort of an environmental libertarian I guess.

Five years ago the electric company in his home state of North Carolina was going to demolish a mountain so that they could run electrical wires through. He bought the mountain and kicked them off his property. It was badass. He's bought tons of land in North Carolina and kept it for conservation purposes (after taxes, too, which is badass of him so the state doesn't get screwed) and has a very strong anti-government belief system. You can read more about his conservation efforts [on this website](https://wncmagazine.com/feature/land_we_trust) second from the bottom.

I'm definitely not one to put faith in billionaires to do the right thing, but knowing the quality of Tim Sweeney's character I'd certainly hope he'd remain true to his word.

The streisand effect is when you want something removed and it then goes viral and spreads like wildfire.


from [wikipediea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)


>The Streisand effect is a phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.

>It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.",RandomWeirdo,t1_f32m4gq,3,0

- establish latitude with sun up sun down times.
- check against constellations.
- identify sounds of local fauna.
- look at flight contrails in the sky, cross reference all US filights to find two that cross at the correct angle at the correct time.
- send out scouts in the area honking horns.
- verify location. Switch flag.

That's some actual CIA shit.

EDIT;
- flag goes to a public exhibit in Liverpool UK. On the roof of an art gallery.
- they know 4 chan will come. They are ready. Security is tight.
- 4chan gets to work, surveys building. Identifies safe route to flag once on roof.
- Operatives scout building and realise direct roof access isn't viable.
- 4chan plans literal step by step access from nearby roof.
- Strike team is go. They get onto flag. But encounter a problem. Flag is cable tied.
- AND THE NORMIES FORGOT SCISSORS.

Similar to how /r/army is going to censor any negative shit about the army or how t_D banned anything liberal or left winged. Does that mean that Reddit is now a pro army, conservative owned website? FUCK no, reddit is generally left leaning and has many times criticized the military. 

Yet in the general subreddit, ya know, where 99% of users are, nothing is getting censored.

You've also entirely ignored that Anti Chinese government and Pro Hong Kong and Pro Human Rights posts that rally against China are massively up voted and sent to the front. And most importantly **kept there.**

Sorry to say, but in real life taking a biased sample size and applying it to everywhere else is fucking wrong. People would look at your ""research"" and laugh it out of the room. That's as if I took a survey and only looked at rich white Americans, and came to the conclusion that there is no issues with wealth, race, or medical care in our country. That's a biased as fuck sample you are using to apply generally and that's where you're wrong.

Unless you can provide me substantial proof that in the general reddit, where most redditors and traffic goes to, that there is at least *one* instance of censorship, then I'll concede. But if you provide me subreddit that are obviously shilled by China but are so tiny and such a small fraction of Reddit, then of course, I'll disregard you.

Also, *those are mods*, who aren't in any control of power over the actual website. Unless I see admins and Reddit staff deleting stuff on the general reddit, then l agree with you. But you have shown nothing substantial or anything that isn't riddled with inherent bias to be used.

You have only used biased, non substantial evidence to back up claims about the entirety of the website. You used a very tiny minority of subreddit and users to make broad claims. You can't take a sample of size of less than 5% and say it equally applies to the rest of the population.

dfdqf8,f37ukdz,"One reason why I say Reddit doesn't censor anything is because I've learned a lot about the CCP's atrocities through Reddit. I never saw any actual nitty gritty pictures of th Tiannemen Massacre before until Reddit showed pictures of bodies flayed on the ground with Tanks driving through. Or even about how China was already illegally extrapediting HK citizens. I've learned a lot about China's shit from Reddit. 

The problem is Tencent owns such a tiny share of Reddit that it hardly matters. What is it, like 5 to 10 percent? Tencent would have to invest BILLIONS at this point to have any major sway over Reddit. Which is how much money they pumped into Riot. Samething WITH Epic, which they have like, a 40% share in. 

Remember how Riot was underfire for protecting Chinese markets over western ones? Then they released some Kpop shit and everyone loves them despite the fact that they're literally 100% Chinese owned. 

You haven't provided any evidence of REDDIT STAFF doing the censorship. The problem with mods is that they aren't staff and can be shills, which most are for whatever biases or power-hungry shit they run on.

Also, that's your problem, you expect the average user to be on Chinese subreddit and whatnot. I'm fucking Korean so why on earth would I be on a Chinese subreddit? And that's your issue, the average user, and thus, what they see on average, won't have any censorship issues that you've mentioned. Hell, I don't even visit Korean based subs. 

Sorry, that I don't go outside of /r/all cause why do I need to? Reddit isn't where I do my evidence searching or anything at the such. So if the average user isn't facing censorship, does that mean reddit is censoring shit, or does that mean there exist Chinese shills that moderate the larger China subs? In yhat case, is Reddit to blame? Fact is that the average user is getting exposed to china's crimes from Tiannemen square to even now. 

Either way, the fact you're calling me a shill is just funny. Ignorant? That's a fair claim because I've never visited any Chinese subs cause I don't give a shit about them. But a shill? Yeah, that's just ridiculous. All I care about is that people don't muddy the water with myths and facts.

You tackle a government like China with anything less than truths, and they'll absolutely spin the story on you. They're killing and harvesting 1.5 million Muslims and putting them in camps. They're kidnapping people forcefully in Hong Kong way before the protests began. They even would kidnap Chinese artists who used to criticize the government and traumatized them to the point that they quit their art. There's no fucking time to place blame on places where it doesn't matter. Pressure those that do like blizzard, NBA, Riot, and those that attempted to appear the Chinese market like Ubisoft. The CCP don't care and will do anything to delegitamize all claims. And if there's something that isn't true and is based off of sensationalism or conspiracy, then you give them more power. 

If you haven't, go watch the documentary on AI Weiwei. It's a chilling documentary on how the Chinese government will pervert a man's freedoms just cause he makes the right statements against China. The Chinese government even posted surveillance vans outside his house for a long period of time. It's titled ""AI Weiwei: Never Sorry"". 

Either way, I'm done with this conversation as we're on the same side, but arguing for something that doesn't matter in the grand scheme. We'll just agree to disagree on whether China is censoring Reddit, but I'll also say one quick thing: Fuck China.",ScourJFul,t1_f36u2rw,1,0

Now if you believe 5% shareholding grants you THIS MUCH POWER you seriously need a reality check. It's just algorithm, nobody will bother hardcoding just to censor this sub so that it can potentially fuck up the whole system. Look up ""goolge ceo congress hearing"" on youtube, and those confused congress people are an accurate representation of this nonsense.

Edit: I‚Äôm so sick and tired of ppl calling me a bot a wumao a Chinese ccp shill or whatever. Do I need to tell you my social security number to shut you the f up?

When implementing a search algorithm, often you split a search in to tokens (and then stem the tokens, etc.) so that searches for similar things like ‚Äòdo‚Äô , ‚Äòdoing‚Äô and ‚Äòdone‚Äô  get similar results, or at least that‚Äôs the intention. A tokeniser can only split where it has been told it‚Äôs ok to split - splitting on white space, and punctuation like `_`, `-` and `:` for instance is an easy rule, as it probably won‚Äôt break things. How is a tokeniser to know `HongKong` is safe to split in to `Hong` and `Kong`? This may require some knowledge, or context, about what the word means. A counterexample would be something like `SpaceX`, which should not be split in to `Space` and `X` though it follows the same capitalisation rule (also most people are lazy and search in lowercase).",anangusp,t3_cw0jht,2,3

cw0jht,ey83sdu,"Note that the search OP is talking about is on the app, assuming it is the official app because otherwise the post will make little to no sense, reddit website doesn't show those results.

So now that we talk about the app (though the following could apply even if we talked about the website), one reason that the algorithm might've preferred giving you many other results instead of ""HongKong"" when you typed in something like ""Hongkon"" could be because of some kind of text prediction search, which assumes that if you already typed in the word as far as that, you might not be searching for ""HongKong"", but maybe for ""HongKongExpats"". The presence of the underscore could also not matter much, as there is nothing wrong to use an underscore in naming a subreddit, many do, so reddit devs might've completely disregarded the importance of an underscore presence or absence in their regex search algo. Oh and the Hong_Kong subreddit is the second biggest one, even though it only has 1.6k members, being the second biggest one makes more sense than the pro-China variable and if nothing - that sub having a more active community than the others (I haven't checked this though), would make a better variable than the assumed one. If this happened on the website, we would be able to actually compare the today's results with the ones when reddit was open source (about 2 years ago), and see further how does that part of the code worked or differs.

Now, Tencent owning an estimate of around 5-6% of reddit, I don't believe that they will ever try to request pushing such a specific change in the code for those searching HongKong, and even if they did I doubt that they will ever get it, at least on that investment.",petyper,t3_cw0jht,1,0

If someone is manipulating the results - it's for one reason and one reason only. It's to muddle the mixture.

If all posts would go against what it's ""known"" people would react stronger, actions would be taken. It would be simple.

This side or that side.

The side who can create alternate views; ""some say x some say y"" is the way to go for someone who does not want a clear say so they can act while people talk about petty details.

Russian desinformation regarding flights who got shot down should serve as a study point for this. And remember. You might not be the target. It might be an internal thing that they don't care about your opinion per se, as long as they create the diversion needed at home.

That's because 2 of the comments are from shadowbanned users.  Shadowbanning is where the user is not banned from logging in, viewing, or even posting, but the only person who can actually see their post is the user themselves.  Nobody else sees anything, except the phantom post count.

Shadowbanning is *supposed* to be reserved for bots -- if the bot doesn't report back that it's been banned (i.e. it can no longer post), then the bot wrangler will probably let the bot keep on doing it's thing.  This gives the bots a longer lifespan before being replaced (however long it takes for the bots owner to recognize the shadowban), lessening the amount of moderation required to keep bots in check.

I'm telling you why. 

Reddit implement the search function based on association index, not just literal search. Hong Kong is written as 'È¶ôÊ∏Ø' in Chinese. The word 'È¶ô' is actually pronounced as 'Xiang' in Mandarin, not 'Hong'. 'Hong Kong' is Cantonese. The word 'Hong' in Mandarin can be lot of words: Á¥Ö (red), Ê¥™ (flood, surname), ÂÆè (board scene), È¥ª (mythological giant bird), Ëôπ (rainbow), Èªå (education place) and other 50+ words. The association of 'Hong' to r/HongKong is not top in the list, and it's nothing particular that it's even lower than 'Hong_Kong', as 'Hong_Kong' is more fitting to the writing habits in computer languages for Asians.

And now thanks to this post, the emerged clicks to r/HongKong had bring the association index of that subreddit to top. Just that simple.

It's neither conspiracy nor shitty search function. It's just OP that didn't understand how the search works under-table.",ulyssesric,t1_ey7zplz,1,1

I'm referencing the old model, where you saw +100 upvotes -25 downvotes Score=75.

If you have an extremely controversial position and all you see is -400 points, you shut the fuck up mighty quick, between that and all the disgusting amounts of vitriol people feel entirely free to level upon me.

But, if you see -400 points (Upvotes 1000, downvotes 1600) all of a sudden, there isn't a blatant and naked ""Narrative"" that all of Reddit unanimously agrees upon. It's basic human psychology. What really infuriates me about most of you normal folks is your ignorance on how advanced manipulation techniques are.

Propaganda is at least a century ahead of what most of you believe it is. I'm not even well ranked, I'm literally just some guy who reads books and studies all day because that's what I'm good at. But everyone is always somehow more informed about everything than I am, because they read the news don'tcha know.

I've read literally more than a hundred books over the last three or four years, all as a means of better understanding the world around us and yet somehow, every fucking Redditor is not only better informed than I am, but they're also totally free to dismiss and mock me for my information, because it doesn't align with their incredibly myopic view of reality, which they've been deeply manipulated into believing, despite the complete lack of any real, tangible evidence for it in reality.

https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_api_subreddit_autocomplete
> Uses typeahead endpoint to recieve the list of subreddits names. Typeahead provides exact matches, typo correction, fuzzy matching and boosts subreddits to the top that the user is subscribed to.

Fuzzy matching is weird, this is an example of fuzzy match sorting. There are some examples in there that are the same as the scenario happening with HongKongTravels showing up before HongKong.

No you didnt, by saying it is dystopian with no reasoning behind it, youre just making a bold claim without any proof.

Do you even know what dystopian means?  There is neither a great suffering/injustice happening in germany nor is there a totalitarian system.

> There isn't any utopian civilization where everything is fair and just and where all people are happy.

I never claimed there is. The question is how much is suffering there is, if the government is doing anything to change the 'suffering' and if people are able to decide on their own.

>But you say, our society in general isn't dystopian, so what does make China dystopian?

A totalitarian state with highly censored and altered media, where theres no alternative to your current government sounds pretty much dystopian to me. 

>Are you saying this based on security cameras? How exactly are security cameras a bad thing?

First of all, youre putting 100% of the population on surveillance for the 0.0X % that commit major crimes. Youre literally invading everyones privacy and are able to track peoples behaviour. Not to mention this is easily exploitable, any person becomes vulnerable to blackmailing. Everyone who has access to these cameras recordings could find out if public figure xy is for example visiting self-help groups for XY.

>Doesn't it improve everyone's security?No it doesn't. Any independent study or meta-analysis will tell you public surveillance has no impact on crimerates. The claim that it does help comes from cctv manufacturers and the people that want to implement these surveillance techniques.

Have you even been to China before saying it's more dystopian than other places?

>I never claimed there is. The question is how much is suffering there is, if the government is doing anything to change the 'suffering'

You seem pretty badly informed. The government, while being totalitarian, is doing much more for its people than EU government do for theirs. It's not even close.

Over a few decades, hundreds of million of Chinese have been taken out of extreme poverty. The vast majority of Chinese people does not suffer more than you do in Germany. I'd argue they're happier in fact, because the economy is booming, which isn't the case in EU.

>A totalitarian state with highly censored and altered media, where theres no alternative to your current government sounds pretty much dystopian to me.

Keyword being **""to me""**. I'll recommend  you the video I posted above once more, which covers that topic.

>First of all, youre putting 100% of the population on surveillance for the 0.0X % that commit major crimes. Youre literally invading everyones privacy and are able to track peoples behaviour.

Well honestly, just don't do things that are prejudicial to yourself and why would you ever care? Do you think you that important that the government cares about you buying a pack of condoms to cheat on your wife?

I can't speak for Germany, but there are CCTV everywhere in England, in France and in the US. Admittedly not as much, but still. Yet somehow, it's only bad when China does it.

And honestly, I can't wrap my head around the fact the people don't mind a significant increase of criminality just for the sake of not being filmed in their day to day life.

>No it doesn't. Any independent study or meta-analysis will tell you public surveillance has no impact on crimerates. The claim that it does help comes from cctv manufacturers and the people that want to implement these surveillance techniques.

Well China's criminality rate is extremely low though. Do you truly believe it's a coincidence?

I seriously doubt your claim of independent study showing public surveillance has no impact on crimerates, but even if that was true, it sure as hell make catching criminals much easier.

And honestly, if you think that mass surveillance is something exclusive to China, open your eyes mate. Every month there's a new scandal about a multinational doing dodgy shit with their consumer's data. I mean, have you ever heard of Snowden?

It really depends in who's shoes you're walking in.

Its obvious you have no idea how things work in germany. People who cant afford things like food/apartments etc. get special help by the government, not to mention there atleast is minimum wage limit. Unemployed people get their apartment, food paid by the government and get free job training.

> As a Westerner, you judge this system to be not legitimate because it's fundamentally different than what Westerners want a government to be, but Chinese people disagree with you. And many HKers might agree with you, but no matter what they say, they're enjoying freedom granted by a different system.

No, Im not saying its illegitimate. Im saying its hugely flawed for several reasons. 1) China claims to own different regions, which are totally not theirs (best example RC aka Taiwan & 9Dashline conflict). 2) People have no impact on what the government decides, even if its for the worse of the people. We all know what happened in the 60s and in 1989. 3) opression of minorities. I know chinese citizens like to downplay this one, but it just shows that human rights are 100 years late in china. 4) Censorship and state-propaganda isnt really what makes a system more trustable.

Just to give you a quick thought, in germany the government is not allowed to have their own news-outlet, because everyone knows what propaganda can do to people. We have learned it ourselves the hard way.

Not to mention state-funded western social media propaganda sounds like the chinese government is afraid of the west, I wonder why.

Also being quiet doesn't equal agreeing or consent. Especially when a government already struck down protests with the military and is built on surveillance and censorship.

>You seem pretty badly informed. The government, while being totalitarian, is doing much more for its people than EU government do for theirs. It's not even close.
Over a few decades, hundreds of million of Chinese have been taken out of extreme poverty. The vast majority of Chinese people does not suffer more than you do in Germany. I'd argue they're happier in fact, because the economy is booming, which isn't the case in EU.

Im not gonna go into this, because it's obvious youre quite uninformed making such bold claims.

> Well honestly, just don't do things that are prejudicial to yourself and why would you ever care? 

Aaaah, the good old 'if you have nothing to hide' argument. It doesnt matter what I do, its just not the states matter or any police-officers matter. Just repeating a flawed argument 100x doesnt make it right. This is the point where china and the u.s. have much to learn.

>Do you think you that important that the government cares about you buying a pack of condoms to cheat on your wife?

Oh believe me, if youre a powerful, well known person only one person having access needs to be tempted to blackmail you. Who says it needs to be cheating on your wife, maybe its you having cancer visiting specialised hospitals or literally anything.

> I seriously doubt your claim of independent study showing public surveillance has no impact on crimerates, but even if that was true, it sure as hell make catching criminals much easier.

Then do some research instead of making false claims on reddit.

>And honestly, if you think that mass surveillance is something exclusive to China, open your eyes mate. Every month there's a new scandal about a multinational doing dodgy shit with their consumer's data. I mean, have you ever heard of Snowden?

You'd think with all these alleged ""murders"" there'd be at least one case of some CCTV footage or an eye witness showing police bringing someone to a roof top -- I mean surely you'd be shouting out if that happened to you right? Or there'd be someone who got away, or there'd be neighbours reporting shouting, or neighbours reporting seeing police leave the apartment or roof top... but as far as I've seen there's none of that. Just ad nauseam allegations that never have any proof or evidence to back them up, but they've become so common that thinking shifts to ""isn't it obvious?""

If the UK does decides to do something, then unfortunately NATO has no obligation to assist even if the UK states that China went against their treaty and Hongkong is then a UK territory again. As the area Hongkong is in is exempt from NATO response. The rest of the NATO countries could technically ignore it if they chose, but that would then rely on countries relationships.

2. Chow Tsz Lok Death: the university student was found after he was fallen from third to second floor of a car park as police carried out dispersion operation nearby.

3. 8.31 Prince Edward Incident: There is no direct proof that any died during the police operation but speculations had been running wild ever since that people are missing. The railroad company refused to release CCTV footage on that day which only fuel these assumptions.
4. There are numerous cases where the person fell but without blood or the hands were tied but the police concluded it was not suspicious

An Associated Press (AP) investigation revealed in 2017 that more than 100 United Nations (UN) peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti over a 10-year period and none were ever jailed. The report further found that over the past 12 years there have been almost 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other UN personnel around the world. AP found the abuse is much greater than previously known. After the AP report, U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, urged all countries to hold UN peacekeepers accountable for any sexual abuse and exploitation.

All of those conflicts that you brought up are minor conflicts throughout the world. The members of the UN Security Council have powers to essentially control everything in the UN. Guess who are permanent members?

Russia, China, and The United States. Anything that goes through the UN can be vetoed by members in the permanent Security Council. That includes China. Which literally voids any power that the UN holds that are against those governments. 

Which is why the Peace keepers help Cyprus, Kosovo, and Kuwait (et cetera). But don‚Äôt go near places of infighting such as current Hong Kong.

Agreements and balance of powers.
  
The UN can only act in areas that are willing to accept UN assistance.

It‚Äôs kinda like a cop from another state not being allowed authority in another jurisdiction without his chiefs approval and that area‚Äôs authorization.

For example; Kosovo was originally an area of Yugoslavia, but a civil war was underway after the death of its ruler Josep Tito, who had kept the peace between the different populations in Yugoslavia.  
Yugoslavia being a founding member of the UN, allowed access for the UN into the conflict.  
  
Due to treaties and agreements signed between the UN and Yugoslavia, the UN was able to act in ways that it could not have if Yugoslavia had not been a member of the UN.  
So, when the Yugoslav War kicked off, the UN already had a foothold in the area and used it to operate its security and aid element in that conflict to assist in the prevention of a genocide of Kosovaars, and in general try to keep the peace.
  
With China, who is one of the few permanent members of the UN Security Council, they have veto powers that can block the UN from
fully acting.  
That is what‚Äôs happening now.  

While there is a serious issue brewing in HK, the UN can only act if China agrees.

A well equipped army, with no regards for their own citizens (concentration camps anyone?), against people gathered in the streets? You think they would mind killing 10-20k HKers if they started attacking the military with firearms? They did it exactly 30 years ago and got absolutely no repercussions from it. 

They would install a curfew, heavily patrol the streets with armored vehicles and wipe out every protester trying to do anything. The protesters might be armed and determined, but not with a military budget and with no training. Life is not Call of Duty. The wouldn't need to carpet bomb the city and the damage to infrastructure wouldn't be that big of a deal for the soon to be largest world economy with a 6+% growth.

China has an international image to somewhat preserve. There are already crimes committed by police, executions, etc. but they won't go full blast as long as they don't have a reason that appears legitimate.

Once the public is fed up for good (support for the protests is starting to dwindle a bit already), and LE takes some casualties, the protesters are finished, unfortunately. No pro gun nut propaganda will change anything about that.
